# Customer_Behaviour_Analysis
End-to-end data analytics project using MySQL for data cleaning and EDA, and Power BI to build an interactive customer behaviour dashboard with actionable insights.



Customer Behaviour Data Analytics Project

Project Overview -
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behaviour using a structured data analytics workflow.  
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, and an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize customer insights.
The goal of the project is to understand customer purchasing patterns and demonstrate practical skills in data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and business intelligence reporting.



Project Files -
customer_shopping_behavior.csv - Raw customer behaviour dataset |
data_cleaning.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing |
SQL_EDA.sql - SQL queries used for exploratory data analysis in MySQL |
customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix - Power BI dashboard visualizing customer insights |


Tools & Technologies Used -
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Jupyter Notebook – Data preparation workflow  
- MySQL – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL  
- Power BI – Interactive dashboard and data visualization  


Project Workflow -

1. Data Loading
   - Loaded the raw customer behaviour dataset from CSV.

2. Data Cleaning
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
   - Standardized column names and data formats.
   - Prepared clean data for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Performed EDA using MySQL queries.
   - Analyzed customer demographics, spending behaviour, and purchase patterns.

4. Data Visualization
   - Connected MySQL to Power BI.
   - Built an interactive dashboard to present key insights clearly.


Key Insights - 
- Customer purchasing trends across categories
- Spending patterns based on customer attributes
- High-value customer segments
- Overall transaction behaviour


How to Use This Project - 
1. Open data_cleaning.ipynb to view the data cleaning steps.
2. Import the cleaned data into MySQL.
3. Run queries from SQL_EDA.sql for analysis.
4. Open customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard.


Conclusion -
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics pipeline from raw data to actionable insights using industry-relevant tools. It reflects practical experience in handling real-world datasets and presenting insights in a business-friendly manner.
